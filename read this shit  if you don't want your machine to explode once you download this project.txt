ight i dunno why you would want to use this shit but you know it's your life

install this shit


pip install PyDirectInput
pip install SpeechRecognition
pip install PyAutoGUI

and pyaudio but that's shit hard as shit for me atleast so use a yt tutorial


then just run the shit using cmd

designed for cs:go

(open the .py up with an ide for the commands)
